Several barns and outbuildings were also destroyed. Twelve buildings at the Buckeye Egg Company were destroyed, trapping one million chickens inside.26.01999-10-13339°36'N / 82°59'W39°37'N / 82°57'W3.50 Miles440 Yards064.0M0Pickaway Brief Description: A tornado touched down west of Circleville, pulling a small shed off of its foundation and destroying a section of a construction building. after this, the tornado lifted and then touched down in a more developed area in town. It destroyed a building housing two businesses and ripped the roof off of a section of a strip mall, ejecting furniture from inside the structure. A large sign weighing several hundred pounds was ripped from its foundation and blown twenty feet away. A tractor trailer with a load of 18 to 19 tons was blown over and dragged ten feet away from where it landed. The tornado then proceeded to a housing development where several homes were destroyed, several roofs ripped off, and garages either destroyed or moved from their foundations. Trees were twisted and broken off at their bases and carports were also torn from nearby houses.\r",

      "A cold front pushed east from Illinois and Indiana during the afternoon hours and combined with a vigorous upper level disturbance that dropped into the Ohio Valley from the lower Great Lakes region. These factors prompted a squall line to develop ahead of the cold front that moved southeast through the Wilmington Ohio (ILN) county warning area before entering northeast Kentucky and southeast Ohio.26.51957-06-11240°18'N / 82°42'W0.50 Mile100 Yards0025K0Knox27.11958-05-22239°35'N / 82°58'W39°37'N / 82°48'W9.00 Miles30 Yards03250K0Pickaway29.01971-02-22239°37'N / 83°15'W2.00 Miles100 Yards0025K0Fayette29.71965-04-11240°23'N / 83°15'W40°25'N / 83°01'W12.30 Miles400 Yards4352.5M0Delaware30.41973-05-10340°01'N / 83°36'W39°55'N / 83°31'W8.00 Miles300 Yards043K0Clark30.41973-05-10339°55'N / 82°30'W39°55'N / 82°20'W8.70 Miles300 Yards013K0Perry30.61965-04-11240°22'N / 83°16'W40°23'N / 83°15'W0525K0Union31.01965-11-27240°02'N / 82°27'W40°06'N / 82°22'W5.90 Miles300 Yards01250K0Licking31.71965-04-11240°25'N / 83°01'W40°28'N / 82°50'W9.90 Miles400 Yards0222.5M0Morrow31.91985-05-31340°10'N / 82°43'W40°14'N / 82°11'W27.00 Miles150 Yards12025.0M0Licking35.01958-07-22240°05'N / 82°25'W40°04'N / 82°15'W8.60 Miles200 Yards0025K0Licking35.51998-08-25240°14'N / 82°29'W40°10'N / 82°16'W10.00 Miles250 Yards00300K0Licking Brief Description: A tornado knocked down numerous trees, destroyed 2 barns, and caused significant damage to 4 homes.35.71965-11-16240°12'N / 83°36'W0.20 Mile33 Yards0425K0Champaign35.81986-03-10239°29'N / 83°34'W39°42'N / 83°17'W22.00 Miles100 Yards102.5M0Fayette36.11981-06-13239°53'N / 82°19'W2.00 Miles250 Yards02250K0Perry36.41960-08-21240°30'N / 83°11'W40°30'N / 83°05'W4.50 Miles880 Yards0025K0Marion36.81974-04-03539°47'N / 83°43'W39°55'N / 83°36'W10.90 Miles533 Yards002.5M0Clark37.51979-08-08240°31'N / 83°08'W1.20 Miles50 Yards00250K0Marion37.71981-06-13340°30'N / 82°54'W40°33'N / 82°51'W3.80 Miles350 Yards45625.0M0Morrow38.22010-09-16239°45'N / 82°24'W39°45'N / 82°16'W7.00 Miles800 Yards01500K0KPerry Brief Description: EVENT NARRATIVE: This tornado originiated in Fairfield County, but got stronger in western Perry County. The damage path widened as it crossed several north to south oriented roads. A convergent damage pattern was evident. Large trees were snapped along Avalon Road. A greater swath of tree and structural damage was along Otterbein Road. The damage path widened to as much as 800 yards, though the southern portion of the path was dominant. The tornado unleashed it worst winds as it continued east to encounter Palomino Road and County Township Road 138. At this stage, there was aproximately a 1 mile long and 100 yard wide path of EF2 strength winds, estimated at 110 to 120 mph. A manufactured home on Palomino Road was missing 95 percent of it roof covering and 40 to 50 percent of the roof supports and interior ceilings were missing. The woman inside was injured when a hallway door struck her in the back. There were at least 2 eyewitnesses to the actual tornado. Almost a mile east on County Township Road 138 a cluster of houses was heavily damaged. The worst damage was a newer 2 story single family home, but seemed to be of the manufactured home quality. Its roof and garage were completely blown off and thrown away. The tornado began to weaken as it headed across County Road 25. The tornado further weakened during its final 1.5 miles, ending near the intersection of County Roads 122, 123, and 134. About 8 homes were destroyed in this tornado. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A cold front, in tandem with strong mid and upper level forcing, produced a severe weather outbreak in southeast Ohio into extreme western West Virginia during the late afternoon and evening of Thursday the 16th. The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet. Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum. However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio. It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics. Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms. This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development. Surface dew points ahead of the cold front reached into the mid 60s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the severe thunderstorms exhibited strong rotation, resulting in the spawning of 5 tornadoes. Four of these 5 tornadoes were in Ohio. One of the 4 Ohio tornadoes crossed from Fairfield County into western Perry County. Another 1 of the 4 crossed from Perry into northwestern Morgan County. One tornado patch was solely in western Athens County. The damage continued another 10 miles in Athens County from a strong rear flank downdraft. Finally, the last of the 4 tornadoes in Ohio crossed the Ohio River from northeastern Meigs County into southern Wood County in West Virginia. From storm surveys, this was the strongest tornado. The last tornado path in this outbreak was solely in western West Virginia. Luckily, there were no fatalities in southeastern Ohio. However, there was one death on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River.38.41989-11-15240°26'N / 82°56'W40°36'N / 82°37'W21.00 Miles73 Yards002.5M0Morrow39.01970-04-02240°24'N / 82°29'W2.00 Miles150 Yards01250K0Knox39.01982-03-31240°24'N / 82°29'W1.00 Mile200 Yards04250K0Knox39.02002-11-10340°21'N / 83°33'W40°21'N / 83°33'W2.00 Miles300 Yards0030K0Logan Brief Description: The tornado touched down across the extreme eastern part of the county and moved northeast, continuing into Union County.

      "A low pressure system with an unusually strong mid and upper level jet streak was moving across the Great Lakes with an associated cold front moving across the upper Ohio valley. Thunderstorms developed across Indiana and moved into West-Central Ohio around mid-afternoon with a distinct bow echo causing wind damage from near to Lima to southeast of Columbus. On the southern edge of the first line of storms, a supercell developed over Central Indiana. This storm evolved into a bow echo and swept across the Dayton metro area causing extensive wind damage and a brief tornado in Greene county. Another supercell developed near Cincinnati and moved southeastward along the Ohio River. This storm produced the F3 tornado in Clermont county.49.71981-06-08240°32'N / 82°25'W40°32'N / 82°20'W3.80 Miles50 Yards02250K0Knox* The information on this page is based on the global volcano database, the U.S. earthquake database of 1638-1985, and the U.S. Tornado and Weather Extremes database of 1950-2010.\n",
